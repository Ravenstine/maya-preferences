Autodesk Maya Preferences
=========================

This is where I store my preferences for Autodesk Maya.  Currently, I am using version 2015.

## What makes this different from the default preferences?

As of now, not too much.  I am working on a very low-end machine doing mostly modeling and shading, so my preferences are mostly geared towards making Maya not so incredibly slow on a machine that doesn't have a top of the line GPU or a lot of memory.

## Changelog
- 0.0.1 - Disabled HIK, Bifrost, GPU Cache, EXRL Loader, and XGEN by default.  Background is changed from blue-grey gradient to classic < 2010 grey.
